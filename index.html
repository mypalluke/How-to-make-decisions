                    <p><b>Water is essential to life</b>, without it you cannot survive long. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>There is a difference between surviving and living a good life, <b>wouldn’t you agree?</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>Can you survive on very poor quality water? Yes, you can. Under a circumstance where you had to choose to drink bad tasting water and death, we would probably choose to live. <span class="pause-dot"></span> But there is some water that is completely undrinkable, if you drank it could actually speed up your death. <b>Poisoned or polluted water, sea water.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>The point is we need water to survive, but we need <b>pure clean water to thrive.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>It is similar with decisions. <b>Making decisions is essential to life.</b> In fact, that is a scriptural statement.</p>
                    <p>Turn with me to <b>Deuteronomy 30:19.</b> Notice what the creator puts before his servants. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>

                        19 I take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today that I have put life and death before you, the blessing and the curse; and you must choose life so that you may live, you and your descendants

                    <p><b>You must choose.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>Jehovah taught them what was right and wrong so they could understand. <b>He never took away their free will.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>Jehovah, the Creator, respects us enough to say: "You must choose." He already knows what is best for us; he wants us not only to live, but to thrive—and yet he doesn’t make us do anything. <b>It really is our choice.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>The situation is the same today as with the israelites. There were other ways to live. Other gods to worship. Jehovah wasn’t going to stop them from going that direction, but he warned them. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>Imagine being with an <b>experienced survivalist guide</b> on a hike in the woods. He knows all the plants you can eat, he has all the tools for survival, and a filter for the water you find. <b>Wouldn’t you ask for his help as you are walking along?</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>With Jehovah’s help, we can make wise decisions in every aspect of our life. Today we will see the equipment Jehovah gives to make wise choices, a four step process to make good decisions, and the importance of implementing those decisions. <b>Im excited to share this with you.</b></p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-slate-900">JEHOVAH HAS EQUIPPED US</h2>

                <div class="space-y-8">
                    <p>To have good clean water, you need the right tools: You need a <b>filtration system</b>, you need to know how to use the system, so you need the <b>manual</b>, and you need a <b>test kit</b> to ensure the water is safe. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>To make good decisions, Jehovah has equipped us with the tools to make <b>good clean decisions.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span> We have the Bible in its entirety, we have been endowed with <b>thinking ability</b>, and been given a <b>conscience</b> that when trained by bible principles can test out decisions instantly. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>Jehovah doesn’t just drop off these tools to us and hope for the best, notice his interest in each and everyone of us at <b>Isaiah 48:17</b></p>
                    
                    <div class="scripture-box">
                        <span class="instruction">Read Isaiah 48:17</span>
                        17 This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel: “I, Jehovah, am your God, The One teaching you to benefit yourself, The One guiding you in the way you should walk.
                    </div>

                    <p>Jehovah is our teacher, he wants us to <b>benefit ourselves.</b> We have the manual to life at our disposal: The Bible. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>If you bought a piece of <b>high-end machinery</b>, the first thing you’d do is <b>check the manual.</b> Any serious manual says in bold letters: "Read and fully understand all instructions before operating this device." <b>Why?</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span> Because the manufacturer knows that if you just "wing it," you won't get the results they promised.</p>
                    <p>Jehovah doesn't want us to just "glance" at the Bible when we're in trouble; he wants us to <b>understand the process beforehand.</b> Imagine if you only looked at the manual after you or someone in your family got <b>violently ill</b> from the water you drank. <b>By then, the damage is done.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>So what must we do? <b>We should make it a goal to read his word everyday.</b></p>
                    <p>But we shouldn’t just read it. <b>We must also think deeply on it.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>Notice the Psalmist's secret in <b>Psalm 119:97 and 100</b>:</p>
                    <div class="scripture-box">
                        "How I do love your law! I ponder over it all day long... I act with more understanding than older men, Because I observe your orders."
                    </div>
                    <p>He had more understanding because he didn't just know the orders—<b>he pondered them.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span> What does it mean to ponder over something? <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    
                    <p className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                        <span class="instruction">The Law Example:</span> The Law said: "You must not murder." Point-blank command. But using thinking ability, we see the source: <b>Hatred.</b> Meditating on irritating qualities until you can't stand to be in the same room. <span class="pause-dot"></span> This is why Jesus said in <b>Matthew 5:22</b> that even "continuing wrathful" or "words of contempt" makes us accountable. <span class="pause-dot"></span> <b>Make things right.</b> You cannot worship Jehovah whom you cannot see, if you hate your brother whom you can see. <span class="pause-dot"></span>

                    <p>In the bible we are given <b>“case studies”</b>—records written as a warning to us. (1 Cor. 10:11). So we read Gods word, we ponder, and our <b>conscience is trained.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    <p>Even the best filtration system won't work if the sensors aren't <b>calibrated.</b> Our conscience is that "hardware." We calibrate it using <b>"solid food"</b>—the deeper principles of the Bible. (Hebrews 5:14). <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>

                        We realize we are equipped with these powerful tools. Now we just need to know how to put them into action. Following these bible based steps is similar to a water filtration system.

                <div class="space-y-12">
                    <p>Jehovah has given us a <b>four-step purification process.</b> This could be our decision filtration system. It’s a powerful metal tool that takes a muddy, high-pressure situation and refines it. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>

                    <div>
                        <span class="instruction">Step 1: Don’t be hasty (stop! think!).</span>
                        <p>Based on <b>Pr 21:5</b>: “The plans of the diligent surely lead to success...” In a water filter, the first stage is often a <b>sediment trap.</b> If you force muddy water through a fine filter immediately, you’ll <b>clog the whole system.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span> Spiritually, our "mud" is our <b>raw emotions</b>—panic, pride, or pressure. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                        <div class="scripture-box">
                            <span class="instruction">Read Deuteronomy 32:29</span>
                            29 If only they were wise! They would ponder over this. They would think about their outcome.
                        </div>
                        <p>By being patient, we let the <b>"mud" settle</b> so we can actually see the situation for what it is. <span class="pause-dot"></span> If you rush, you overlook important information. <b>Do not make decisions based solely on your emotions.</b> (Prov. 28:26; Jer. 17:9). <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <span class="instruction">Step 2: Pray for wisdom.</span>
                        <p>Once water looks clear, we use a <b>UV Light.</b> It disrupts the DNA of invisible bacteria. <b>This cannot be effective when the water is cloudy.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span> When we pray as <b>James 1:5</b> suggests, we are asking Jehovah for His light to "sanitize" our thinking from invisible <b>"spiritual viruses"</b>—subtle worldly philosophies. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>

                            5 So if any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously...

                        <p>This is <b>high-pressure filtration</b>, like a fine membrane. This is the <b>hard work.</b> The answers are there. <b>Proverbs 2:3-5</b> shows us: <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                        <div class="scripture-box">
                            "3 Moreover, if you call out for understanding... 4 If you keep seeking for it as for silver... 5 Then you will understand the fear of Jehovah..."
                        </div>
                        <p>We separate human thinking from Jehovah’s wisdom. We use congregation tools and mature christians, but avoid asking <b>“what would you do?”</b> The only one we can throw our burdens on is Jehovah. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <span class="instruction">Step 4: Analyze your motives.</span>
                        <p>Final inspection in a <b>small glass</b>. How does it look? Smell? <b>Taste?</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span> Jehovah wants us to be honest. <b>Pr 16:2</b>: "All of a man’s ways seem right to him, But Jehovah examines the motives." If we aren't sincere, the decision may not stick. <span class="pause-dot"></span></p>
                        <p className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg italic">
                            <b>Example:</b> Young brother pioneering realizes his <b>"taste" is off</b>—he wanted to please his parents. <span class="pause-dot"></span> He recirculates. He goes back to Stage 1, prays, researches. Renewed with vigor and <b>genuine love for Jehovah.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span>
