                    </p>
                    <p class="user-text">
                        But Jehovah gives us <b>exactly what we need</b> to choose correctly. Put simply, he gives us three things: His word the Bible, thinking ability, and our conscience. <span class="pause-dot"></span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="user-text">
                        If you bought a piece of <b>high-end machinery</b> for filtering water, the first thing you’d do is check the manual.

Why? <span class="pause-dot"></span> Because the manufacturer knows that if you just "wing it," you won't get the results they promised.
                    </p>
                    <p class="user-text">
                        Jehovah doesn't want us to just "glance" at the Bible when we're in trouble; he wants us to <b>understand the process beforehand.</b> Imagine if you only looked at the manual after you or someone in your family got <b>violently ill</b> from the water you drank? <span class="pause-dot"></span> By then, the damage is done.
                    </p>
                    <p class="user-text">
                        When a manufacturer includes a "Troubleshooting" section, is it because he wants to restrict you? No, it’s because he wants his machine to <b>work perfectly for you.</b> Notice how Jehovah describes his motive at <b>Isaiah 48:17</b>.

                    <p class="user-text">
                        In a world that prizes "life experience," the Psalmist made a bold claim: that there is a source of wisdom that <b>surpasses the experience</b> of older men. Let’s look at his secret in <b>Psalm 119:97 and 100</b>.
                    </p>

                    <p class="user-text">
                        He had more understanding because he didn't just know the orders—<b>he pondered them.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span> To "ponder" means to look at the <b>"Source Code"</b>—to understand why Jehovah gave the command in the first place.
                    </p>

                    <p class="user-text bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded-md">
                        <span class="instruction">Example:</span> The Law said: "You must not murder." That is point-blank. But using thinking ability, we see the source: <b>Hatred.</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span> Viewing someone as not worth living because of an opposing viewpoint. It starts with meditating on <b>irritating qualities</b> until you can't stand to be in the same room. <span class="pause-dot"></span> This is why Jesus said in <b>Matthew 5:22</b> that even "continuing wrathful" or "words of contempt" makes us accountable. By pondering, we found a principle that covers <b>every aspect of life.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p class="user-text">
                        Every piece of equipment also comes with <b>"test studies."</b> In the Bible, we have the records of real people. 1 Corinthians 10:11 says their stories are <b>"water test results."</b> <span class="pause-dot"></span> We see exactly what happened when someone bypassed the filter.

                    <p class="user-text">
                        Finally, Jehovah endows us with the <b>"Internal Hardware"</b>—thinking ability and a conscience. Notice this "training program" at <b>Proverbs 2:10, 11</b>.

                    <div class="scripture-box">

                        Even the best filtration system won't work if the sensors aren't calibrated. Our <b>conscience</b> is that hardware.
