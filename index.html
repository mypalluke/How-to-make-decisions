                        Really, the question that we need to ask first is: <b>What should guide my decision?</b>

                        <span class="instruction">Visual:</span> We look at this picture and we think, <b>which path to choose</b>. <span class="pause-dot"></span> Interestingly in the picture both roads are narrow. Both are challenging. Isn’t that how life seems sometimes? Its not that you know for sure from the beginning which path will lead to success or not. <b>Its difficult.</b>

                    <p class="user-text">
                        In the world we live in today, everyone is looking for an <b>"Easy Button."</b> People are all to willing to offer you advice on which path to choose. <span class="pause-dot"></span> It’s tempting to just “push the button”, listen to them and hope for the best.

                    <p class="user-text">
                        But here is the reality: <b>that easy button always comes with a cost.</b> You see, in life, we either make our own decisions, or they will be made for us. If we choose to follow the path of least resistance—letting our peers, our social media feed, or even our own raw impulses decide for us—we are at the <b>mercy of the results</b>. <span class="pause-dot"></span> We are essentially drinking from whatever stream the world leads us to, without checking the source.

                        If you bought a piece of <b>high-end machinery</b>, the first thing you’d do is check the manual. Jehovah doesn't want us to just "glance" at the Bible when we're in trouble; he wants us to <b>understand the process beforehand.</b> Imagine if you had a new water filtration system, but you only looked at the manual after you or someone in your family got <b>violently ill</b>? <span class="pause-dot"></span> By then, the damage is done.
