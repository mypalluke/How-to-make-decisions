                                    <p>To have good clean water, you need the right tools: You need a filtration system, you need to know how to use the system, so you need the manual, and you need a test kit to ensure the water is safe.</p>
                                    <p>To make good decisions, Jehovah has equipped us with the tools to make good clean decisions. We have the Bible in its entirety, we have been endowed with thinking ability, and been given a conscience that when trained by bible principles can test out decisions instantly.</p>

                                    <p>Jehovah is our teacher, he wants us to benefit ourselves. We have the manual to life at our disposal: The Bible.</p>
                                    <p>If you bought a piece of high-end machinery for filtering water, the first thing you’d do is check the manual. Any serious manual says in bold letters: \"Read and fully understand all instructions before operating this device.\" Why? Because the manufacturer knows that if you just \"wing it,\" you won't get the results they promised.</p>
                                    <p>Jehovah doesn't want us to just \"glance\" at the Bible when we're in trouble; he wants us to understand the process beforehand. Waiting to consult the manual until after someone gets sick is too late.</p>

                                    <p>In a world that prizes \"life experience,\" the Psalmist made a bold claim: that there is a source of wisdom that surpasses the experience of older men. Let’s look at his secret in Psalm 119:97 and 100:</p>
                                    <div className="scripture-box text-white">
                                        "How I do love your law! I ponder over it all day long... I act with more understanding than older men, Because I observe your orders."
                                    </div>
                                    <p>He had more understanding because he didn't just know the orders—he pondered them. What does it mean to ponder over something? It’s a bit like reverse engineering. It’s taking something apart and seeing how and why it works.</p>
                                    <p className="bg-indigo-900/30 p-8 rounded-2xl border border-indigo-500/20">
                                        Let’s use a simple example Jesus gave us. We see it at Matthew 5:21-23. The Law said: \"You must not murder.\" Jesus lifted the cover off God’s commands.. Murder begins with hatred, so even contemptuous speech matters. Even our thoughts matter. When we ponder over Gods laws it helps us to stop problems at the where the first malfunction starts. We see the principles behind the laws. We learn about Jehovah and who he really is. And we see practical things we need to do in our daily life.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In the bible we are given “case studies” examples of faithful ones that followed Gods laws and principles and examples of ones that disobeyed Gods laws and standards. We see how things turned out for them. 1 Cor. 10:11 says that these were written as a warning to us, the ones upon ‘whom the ends of the systems of things have come’.</p>
                                    <p>So we read Gods word, we ponder over it. What happens? Our conscience that Jehovah has given us is trained. This acts as a sensor to recognize when something is wrong with something we decided on.</p>
                                    <p>Even the best water filtration system won't work if the sensors aren't calibrated to recognize what is clean and what is toxic. Our conscience is that \"hardware.\" We calibrate it using \"solid food\"—the deeper principles of the Bible. As Hebrews 5:14 explains, we don't just learn these to pass a test; we use them as a daily calibration tool.</p>
                                    <p className="text-indigo-400 italic font-bold">Transition from ii to iii: We realize we are equipped with these powerful tools. Now we just need to know how to put them into action. Following these bible based steps is similar to a water filtration system.</p>

                                    <p>Jehovah has given us a four-step purification process. This could be our decision filtration system. It’s a powerful metal tool that takes a muddy, high-pressure situation and refines it until what is left is a clear, safe decision.</p>
                                    <p>So what’s the first step in our filter?</p>

                                        <p>{renderPauses("Step 1: based on Pr 21:5 “The plans of the diligent surely lead to success...” Don’t be hasty (stop! think!). When you’re standing in front of a stream and you’re thirsty, the pressure to just 'drink now' is intense. Life is the same. The pressure to make a quick decision can be muddy. In a physical water filter, the first stage is often a sediment trap. It relies on gravity and time. If you try to force muddy water through a fine filter immediately, you’ll clog the whole system. You have to let it sit so the heavy dirt can sink to the bottom. Spiritually, our \"mud\" is often our raw emotions— (pause one beat) panic, pride, or the pressure to act now.")}</p>
                                        <p>Notice the perspective Jehovah encourages us to have before we take a single step</p>

This is not a wait and see what happens attitude, it is actually diligently pondering the situation and taking further steps to clarify what may be best. If you rush into a decision, you may overlook important information.</p>
                                        <p>Stopping and thinking about things and not making an impulsive decision helps you to remember you may not have all the answers. So now with clarity you remember then to pray. Youve thought things through. You now have the Clarity of mind to even know what to pray for.</p>

                                        <p>Step 2: Pray for wisdom. In water filtration Once the water looks clear, we use a UV Light. UV light doesn't catch dirt; it disrupts the DNA of invisible bacteria so they can't reproduce. This cannot be effective when the water is cloudy.</p>
                                        <p>How can praying for wisdom help? James 1:5</p>
                                        <div className="scripture-box text-white">
                                            5So if any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching, and it will be given him.
                                        </div>
                                        <p>When we pray as James 1:5 suggests, we are asking Jehovah for His light. We are asking Him to neutralize the invisible \"spiritual viruses\"—those subtle worldly philosophies—that might look harmless but could make us spiritually ill. Prayer \"sanitizes\" our thinking at a level we can't see with the naked eye. We are asking Jehovah for his wisdom on the matter. We are showing him we don't want to rely on ourselves but we trust him. He gives generously.</p>
                                        <p>Now we have have humbled ourselves we are ready for the next stage</p>

                                        <p>Step 3: Do thorough research. In water filtration, This is the stage of high-pressure filtration, like a fine membrane. It forces the water through a barrier so microscopic that only the pure water molecules can pass.</p>
                                        <p>This step is the hard work, this is where we separate what feels right from what is right. The answers are there. What will you find? Provers 2:3-5 shows us that wisdom is found only when we search for it like a treasure. What will we find? Lets read vs 4 and 5:</p>
                                        <div className="scripture-box text-white">
                                            3Moreover, if you call out for understanding And raise your voice for discernment; 4If you keep seeking for it as for silver, And you keep searching for it as for hidden treasures; 5Then you will understand the fear of Jehovah, And you will find the knowledge of God.
                                        </div>
                                        <p>This is where we \"dig deep\" into the Bible as Proverbs 2:3-5 describes. We are putting our thoughts under the \"pressure\" of God’s Word. This process separates human thinking from Jehovah’s wisdom. It’s not always the path of least resistance, but it’s the only way to get the salt out. We make good use of tools provided through the christian congregation and mature christians although careful not to pressure them to make a decision for us. We must carry our own load and avoid asking others “what would you do?” the only one we can throw our burdens on is Jehovah.</p>
                                        <p>Now finally we are ready for our final stage in our decision filter:</p>

                                        <p>Step 4: Analyze your motives. Finally, the water has passed through the machine. But before you take a drink, you pour a little into a small glass for a final inspection. You look at it closely: How does it look? How does it smell? And finally, how does it taste?</p>
                                        <p>Jehovah wants us to be honest in all things. So when we make decisions, we want to be honest with ourselves and with others about our motives. If we aren't completely honest, we will likely have difficulty sticking to the decision. Jehovah knows our hearts, we can even fool ourselves sometimes. Pr 16:2 says: All of a man’s ways seem right to him, But Jehovah examines the motives. It’s important to examine ourselves and really test if our decision is sincere. Because if we are not sincere the decision may not stick even if it was a good decision.</p>

This is not good. If we are not careful we can have a good decision and not implement it and then be stuck with someone else making a decision for us. If you don’t decide, a decision will be made for you. This is not what Jehovah wants from us.</p>
